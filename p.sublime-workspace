(There will be unaligned versions later)\n   73  - **in** and **[in, out]** parameters must be initialized (please). But **[out]** parameters not, initializing out param is  also redundant\n   74  - All functions are inline if you don't want to use pre-compiled versions with glmc_ prefix, you can ignore build process. Just include headers.\n   ..\n   80  \n   81  #### 📌 Allocations?\n   82: `cglm` doesn't alloc any memory on heap. So it doesn't provide any allocator. You should alloc memory for **out** parameters too if you pass pointer of memory location. Don't forget that **vec4** (also quat/**versor**) and **mat4** must be aligned (16-bytes), because *cglm* uses SIMD instructions to optimize most operations if available.\n   83  \n   84  #### 📌 Returning vector or matrix... ?\n   ..\n  107  - option to use different clipspaces e.g. Left Handed, Zero-to-One... (currently right handed negative-one is default)\n  108  - array api and struct api, you can use arrays or structs.\n  109: - general purpose matrix operations (mat4, mat3)\n  110  - chain matrix multiplication (square only)\n  111  - general purpose vector operations (cross, dot, rotate, proj, angle...)\n  ...\n  140    #include <cglm/call.h>   /* for library call (this also includes cglm.h) */\n  141  \n  142:   mat4 rot, trans, rt;\n  143    /* ... */\n  144    glm_mul(trans, rot, rt);  /* inline */\n  ...\n  150  \n  151  ```C\n  152:   mat4 m = {\n  153      1, 0, 0, 0,\n  154      0, 1, 0, 0,\n  ...\n  160  ```\n  161  \n  162: Library contains general purpose mat4 mul and inverse functions, and also contains some special forms (optimized) of these functions for affine transformations' matrices. If you want to multiply two affine transformation matrices you can use glm_mul instead of glm_mat4_mul and glm_inv_tr (ROT + TR) instead glm_mat4_inv\n  163  ```C\n  164  /* multiplication */\n  165: mat4 modelMat;\n  166  glm_mul(T, R, modelMat);\n  167  \n  ...\n  422  #### Option 1\n  423  ```C\n  424: mat4 proj, view, model, mvp;\n  425  \n  426  /* init proj, view and model ... */\n  ...\n  432  #### Option 2\n  433  ```C\n  434: mat4 proj, view, model, mvp;\n  435  \n  436  /* init proj, view and model ... */\n  437  \n  438: glm_mat4_mulN((mat4 *[]){&proj, &view, &model}, 3, mvp);\n  439  ```\n  440  \n  441  ## How to send matrix to OpenGL\n  442  \n  443: mat4 is array of vec4 and vec4 is array of floats. `glUniformMatrix4fv` functions accecpts `float*` as `value` (last param), so you can cast mat4 to float* or you can pass first column of matrix as beginning of memory of matrix:\n  444  \n  445  Option 1: Send first column\n\nC:\\Users\\Seafarer\\Projects\\2D
