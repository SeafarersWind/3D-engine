# 3D-engine
This is the product of my study of OpenGL. I aspire develop games and their engines, and creating these demos along the way has been a pleasure.

The code has several dependencies and I won't provide build instructions, but all the demos I've created are available in the releases page.

Currently I am working on bones and animation.
